    "1. Who developed Python Programming Language? \n",
    "=> Guido van Rossum in 1991\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Which type of Programming does Python support? \n",
    "=> It supports:\n",
    "a) web development (server-side),\n",
    "b) software development,\n",
    "c) mathematics,\n",
    "system scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers? \n",
    "=>Yes, it treats upper case and lower case in a different manner\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the correct extension of the Python file? \n",
    "=>ipynb for jupyter. otherwise world widely, its .py\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Is Python code compiled or interpreted? \n",
    "=>it is interpreted language so obviously the code gets interpreted means it gets converted into byte code by Python VM.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language? \n",
    "=> module, class definition, function body\n",
    "\n",
    "7. State a character used to give single-line comments in Python? \n",
    "=> Answer is #\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Mention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on? \n",

    "\n",
    "13. What are the benefits of using Python? \n",
    "=>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\n",
    "Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\n",
    "Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\n",
    "Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\n",
    "Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How is memory managed in Python? \n",
    "Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures. The management of this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager.\n",
